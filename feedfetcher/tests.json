One becomes the leading lobby-watchdog in Brussels, the other one becomes a top lobbyist on world trade issues, representing 50% of the EU&#8217;s economy &#8211; banks, insurances, telecoms, touristic operators and a wide range of business federations.</p> <p>By following one&#8217;s investigations and the other&#8217;s career this film takes us on a journey into the corridors of power of the biggest economy on earth &#8211; the European Union.
