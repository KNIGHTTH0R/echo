Echo README
===========

To set this up you will need to:

0. Dependencies

PHP 5.4
PHP's SQLite module

1. Initialise the databases:
1a. Create the databases from SQL:

	mkdir db
	sqlite3 db/events.sqlite < sql-events.txt
	sqlite3 db/feeds.sqlite < sql-feeds.txt

1b. Make sure they are writable by the web server.  This might mean doing something like:

	chgrp -R www-data db
	chmod -R g+w db

2. Move the right files into place.

The following need to be in a web-accessible folder:
	* css
	* images
	* js
	* index.php

The following do not:
	* lib
	* feedfetch.php
	* templates

3. Set up the config file.

An initial config file is in the package.  It should be called 'echo.ini'.

4. Set up a temp directory for F3:

mkdir temp
chgrp -R www-data temp
chmod -R g+w temp

5. Set up web rewrite rules.

6. Install the Node modules:

htmlstrip-native
sequelize
sequelize-sqlite (?)
sqlite3
ical
feedparser
request


To develop, you will need sass, to build CSS files from the source SCSS files.
